\part{Introduction}
This paper is a simple testement to the materialists, the "rationals", the psychiatrists and the normalist. The hypothesis and the conclusion are the same in this document, \\\\
The Brain is NOT the origin of consciousness, the material reality is simply an ingredient in the pie of the universe, the universe (source, god, etc) is is a conscious entity (in the broadest use of the word), and the material reality (and other realities) can be manipulated using techniques that involve forces and energies beyond the physical world (ie divinity, the subconscious, elemental forces, etc). The knowledge of this fact has been suppressed by the reactionary nature of modern society and mainstream academia.  
\section{Statement of Purpose}
This document is a catalyst. It should spread harmony, realisation of higher truths and give readers an appropriate amount of zeal to both take the first step in a journey of spiritual self-improvement and spread the truth of higher worlds. \\\\
I could certainly go on for a long time about how needed this document is, or i could just save myself some time by shaving the statement of purpose down to two paragraphs, i can then create the rest of the document without bothering to create a long statement of purpose.
\subsection{Who are we?}
This document is written as a part of the foundation of Astronomica, as well as being another resource for the society, it is a more in-depth resource for the more scholarly folks among us. 
\subsection{Why are we making this?}
It's simple. No genuinely impactful thing similar to this has been written before. The people need a document to choose between the reason of spirit and the terracotta impulse and the lies of society.
\subsection{And what are we going to do with it?}
Distribute it. Simply. Introduce the world to the reality it lives in.
\part{Do we have proof of these other worlds?}
\section{Yes, it's complicated.}
I am going to make a quite bold statement here; there is no compelling argument for materialism. It is simply logic that there would be more to reality than the physical one. These internalised realisations make people go "crazy" in the eyes of most people, but when understood, they can change the life of whoever the realisation befalls. \\\\
The annoying thing about this entire topic is, the topic of higher reality goes hand in hand with higher realisation and understanding. This material cannot be taught academically. It cannot be memorised, it cannot be learned from one glance over a book. Higher realities are meant to be understood, not "learned", and this shows when trying to measure higher realities scientifically. Either millions of people have an extremely strong delusion, or the knowing of higher worlds is a natural step for humanity. "Theism as a Psychological Fact", as our subconscious knows more than the physical world, and that knowing is transferred to the conscious mind at a certain point in people's lives. \\\\

\section{Who to believe?}
\footnote{Atheist's Library, Kvinn.org/atheists}
Well that's a good question. Many people have models of what they believe source to be, and how it effects us. For example, a man named Wilhelm Reich discovered an energy he called "orgone" and measured its effect on the physical world. He found a way to manipulate it, he found a way to transmute things from good to bad, he found a way to accumulate it. \\\\

For his amazing realisation, the CIA killed him, after years in prison of course. But orgone may be one small piece of the puzzle. Orgone's existance was and can be proven by science. So can "pyramid power", the idea that pyramids do stuff to things inside and outside of them, and that pyramids can channel some sort of energy around.\\\\
\\\\
But there are other models. And Astronomica believes that all of them are right, in some way. With the way that orgone works, we believe it to be an energy that can effect the physical realm, but is not entirely in higher realms. It's entirely possible, if not certain that Orgone is one energy, in multitude of others. \\\\
Speaking of other planes, it has essentially been proven that astral/dream/spirit world travel is real. As well as NDEs (near death experiences), even if these other planes can't be measured by science (they can't, science measures the physical world they can measure the effect of the other worlds on the physical world however. there has not been many studies in this area, but the results from those studies have been promising.) personal experience from former atheists who have took psychedelics, had an NDE or astral projected shows that spirituality is simply a truth that can be found internally. Spirituality can only be observed by science, it is a heavily personal thing. But believe me, people who experience and see things do not go back. Because they learn that this was the missing piece of the puzzle, they include spirituality in basic decisions because it is rational to do so, as it is reality.\\\\
These highly personal journies are steps towards reality, not delusion.\\\\
Another thing, two burning questions. Where is the origin of consciousness and where did the universe come from? The dumbed-down "scientific" answer would be "Oh, the brain and the big bang", but there is no science in this answer. \\\\
Let's have a look at the first question, the origin of consciousness. So you may think that consciousness comes from the brain, as it is the state of which your brain is not asleep. Or something like that. But what is four consciousness? It's not your thoughts, it's not your body, it's not your physical feelings, it's not your emotions, it's you. Some people say it's the observer of your thoughts, and i think this is a good explanation. Of course, it is ridiculous for me to try to explain consciousness on paper, but i can try. But anyway, can consciousness be described and measured by science? No. There are lots of unanswered questions about the brain that cannot be answered simply by "oh it's just the physical world". Even if we could fully explain consciousness, what about the collective unconscious? What about the uncanny valley? The brain is the container of consciousness, just like the body is the container of the brain. (obviously it's not that simple but it makes a bit more sense to use an analogy like that)\\\\
The second question- where did the universe come from? The big bang happened because (this is the current theory) gases compressed and compressed until... Boom! And that's the big bang. But our problem comes from how it happened, not if it happened. Where did those gases come from? Simply, how can we explain that. Saying "They just are there" doesn't make any scientific sense. It's like saying "We breathe because we do". Another thing, black holes. Sure, we know where they come from (sort of) but we don't exactly know where they go. Information paradox, and all that. If we factor in higher worlds that interact in some capacity with this one, we can have a slightly better understanding of alot of our unexplained questions. Via the higher understanding of reality, that allows us to understand our burning questions and ourselves. Neglecting this part of reality is neglecting a part of everything. \\\\
The conclusion of this section: Nothing is entirely real and nothing is entirely false. It is highly likely that there are more "folds" to reality than the physical one. These other "folds" are hard for us to measure, they are to be known and understood, not glared at through a microscope.
\subsection{Maybe yourself?}
An amazing realisation happens in many people who consider themselves to be spiritual, they discover these things personally. And of course religion and spirituality is an extremely personal thing, so there is no problem in attending a plant medicine ceremony in south america, or astral projecting, even though quite alot of people will say that it's "unverified personal gnosis" (stupid term by the way, it devalues personal experience almost as if it is delusion) or "unscientific". Yet, the feelings that can arise from understanding the truth of esoterica cannot be reproduced anywhere else. It is the knowing of truth, the understanding of higher worlds. \\\\
This feeling of knowing truth is not an "internal truth/delusion", it is a feeling given from higher planes, almost as a reward for the knowing of actual truth. In astronomica, we call this knowledge and feeling "Gnosis", or intuitive knowledge. When people realise this kind of thing, they certainly do not forget about it.

\section{What does this mean for us?}
\subsection{Not much}
When you think about it, the realisation of this is not really that impactful on everyday society. These truths have been available literally forever, and we have stopped thinking about them because of the insane materialistic western capitalist culture we live in. 
\subsection{But also alot!}
Think about it. If everyone realises that the physical world is simply a piece of the pie, imagine that great awakening! Imagine how idyillic society would be, imagine the amazing organic buildings people would build! Imagine if we actually communicated with our children and our enemies, imagine what good could come out of this! Imagine harmony.
\part{Can we alter them (and the phyiscal world via them) and how?}
\section{Yes we can!}
People see other people who are metaphysical practitioners and call them crazy. Yet what they are doing is far from crazy. Even though the trivialisation of seriousness via the mainstream media (ie movies, tv shows) makes us believe that we should just have fun and not act outside the prescribed boundaries, no matter how silly it looks to our brainwashed eyes, millions of people have found results in spells and rites. It has been the truth for long enough that you can't even brand people seeing results from metaphysical practice as falling victim to the mass delusion anymore, it has been reality for thousands of years, and to reject that age-old knowledge is to reject a part of yourself.\\\\
Astral projection, dreams and Deja Vu, things that make up the gut instinct have saved thousands from awful things. Everyone knows someone that followed their gut instinct and didn't get on that plane that was going to crash, or didn't talk to that guy who might have killed them. Foresight into the future via "unscientific" and personal knowing is an extremely common thing. It's been happening since the dawn of time, and just now we decide that we have always been wrong, even though following our instincts has never stopped working.
\subsection{But how?}
Advanced meditation techniques, along with astral travel, spells, rituals and remote viewing have proven again and again to have an effect on the material world. Thousands, if not millions have experienced genuine results from metaphysical spells and rituals, even though in the world today they are seen as silly at best and evil scams at worst. I certainly have done things using these methods and have found significant results, whether it be people quitting their jobs for higher paying ones or people breaking their ankles, this manipulation of higher realms with the subconscious then leading to manipulation of the physical reality is something that should not be ignored. Simply, it works. \\\\
Buddhist monks have incredible command of their environment. It has been proven that they can heat their bodies to incredible temperatures. Remote viewers can see things without actually being there. Also, we have an inbuilt magick that is engrained into our psyche, doing stuff all the time that we don't even think about.\\\\ 
So, who to believe? Millions whose life has been meaningfully affected by the unseen or "it doesnt exist because i cant see it". Your choice.
\subsection{Should we?}
Yes, yes we should. I hear silly arguments like "oh but magick is just the devil" but that's a stupid argument. Even using relatively conservative christian logic, the ability and possibility of the manipulation and even viewing of other worlds is something that is made available to us by god, right? What would be the point in making a large part of reality to turn around and say "it's evil don't do anything with it" \\\\
There is an argument about free will, if you're doing things that subtly impact upon the free will of others, it doesn't seem so good if you put it like that. But free will is dead when we are born into a western system with a government to rule over us, parents and teachers to look down on us and condition us, and our "friends" to drag us back into that bucket of crabs. Also if i can impact the free will of another via other planes, it would be highly likely that other, higher forces were also impacting the free will of everyone too.\\\\
The thing that i have a problem with is scientists finding a definitive magic force and synthesising it. This can only cause problems and will probably lead to the destruction of the world after a few years of it being normalised.
