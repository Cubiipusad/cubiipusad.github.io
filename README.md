INT. THE GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Peter and Cleveland are sitting on the couch, watching TV.

CLEVELAND:
Hey Peter, have you ever thought about what would happen if you died?

PETER:
(joking)Oh come on Cleveland, I'm not gonna die. I'm too strong and handsome for that.

CLEVELAND:
I know, I know. But just imagine for a second... what would happen to Lois, and the kids, and Quagmire, and all your friends?

PETER:
(suddenly serious)
I don't know, Cleveland. I guess I never really thought about it.

Suddenly, there's a loud knock on the door. Peter and Cleveland look at each other, confused.

PETER:
Who could that be at this hour?

Peter gets up and opens the door, revealing Death standing there with a grim expression on his face.

DEATH:
Peter Griffin, it's time.

PETER:
Time for what?

DEATH:
Time for you to come with me. Your time on this earth is up.

PETER:
(terrified)
No, no, no! I don't want to die! Please, give me another chance!

DEATH:
I'm sorry, Peter. But it's not up to me. Your time is up.

PETER:
(pleading)
Cleveland, help me! Don't let him take me!

CLEVELAND:
(voice shaking)
I'm sorry Peter, there's nothing I can do. Death is unstoppable.

PETER:
(crying)
Lois! Meg! Chris! Brian! Somebody, help me!

But it's too late. Death takes Peter by the hand and leads him away, leaving Cleveland alone in the living room.

INT. THE GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Lois, Meg, Chris, and Brian are sitting on the couch, crying. Cleveland is standing nearby, looking somber.

LOIS:
(sobbing)
I can't believe Peter is gone. He was my everything.

MEG:
(crying)
I'll never get to see him again.

CHRIS:
(crying)
He was like a dad to me.

BRIAN:
(voice shaking)
He was a good man, and a good friend. He will be missed.

CLEVELAND:
(tearful)
I know how much you all loved Peter. And I know how hard this is for all of us. But we have to be strong. We have to support each other and remember all the good times we had with Peter.

LOIS:
(voice trembling)
You're right, Cleveland. We need to remember the good times. And we need to make sure Peter's memory lives on.

MEG:
(voice breaking)
But how can we do that? How can we keep his memory alive?

CLEVELAND:
(resolute)
I have an idea. Let's go to the cemetery and pay our respects to Peter. And let's jump into his grave, just like he used to do for his favorite TV show characters.

LOIS:
(nodding)
Yes, that's a great idea. Let's do that.

ERY

The Griffins and Cleveland are standing around Peter's grave, tears in their eyes. Lois is holding a bouquet of flowers.

LOIS:
(voice trembling)
Peter, we miss you so much. You were a wonderful husband, father, and friend. You brought so much joy and laughter into our lives.

MEG:
(voice breaking)
I'll never forget the times we spent together, dad. You always made me feel loved and supported.

CHRIS:
(voice shaking)
I'm going to miss your goofy jokes and your terrible dancing. But most of all, I'm going to miss your love and guidance.

BRIAN:
(voice shaking)
Peter, you were one of the kindest, funniest, and most generous people I've ever known. I'll never forget you.

CLEVELAND:
(voice choked with emotion)
Peter, you were like a brother to me. I'm going to miss your stupid jokes and your endless supply of beer. But most of all, I'm going to miss your friendship.

Lois, Meg, Chris, Brian, and Cleveland all look at each other, tears streaming down their faces.

CLEVELAND:
(voice breaking)
Okay, let's do it. Let's jump into Peter's grave, just like he used to do for his favorite TV show characters.

The Griffins and Cleveland take a deep breath and jump into Peter's grave, one by one. As they land on the soft earth, they cling to each other, crying and mourning the loss of their loved one.

CUT TO:

INT. THE GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The Griffins and Cleveland are sitting on the couch, still in shock and grief. Lois is holding a photo of Peter, tears in her eyes.

LOIS:
(voice trembling)
I don't know how we're going to get through this, guys. Peter was our rock, our foundation. Without him, I don't know what we're going to do.

MEG:
(voice breaking)
We'll get through this, mom. We have each other, and we have our memories of Peter. We'll remember him, and we'll keep his spirit alive in our hearts.

CHRIS:
(voice shaking)
Yeah, we'll never forget Peter. And we'll make sure his memory lives on, no matter what.

BRIAN:
(voice shaking)
That's right, guys. We have to be strong for each other, and for Peter. He would want us to keep going, even without him.

CLEVELAND:
(voice choked with emotion)
I agree, guys. Peter was a special person, and he touched all our lives in so many ways. We have to remember him, and we have to honor his memory.

The Griffins and Cleveland all nod, tears in their eyes. They sit together in silence, remembering their lost loved one and the many happy memories they shared with him.

FADE TO BLACK.

Continue to scene where peter jumps out of the wall and says "Surprise!"

Suddenly, the wall behind the couch bursts open, and Peter pops out, grinning.

PETER:
(laughing)
Surprise, guys! I'm not dead!

The Griffins and Cleveland all gasp in shock and disbelief.

LOIS:
(voice trembling)
Peter, is that really you? We thought you were...

PETER:
(grinning)
Nope, I'm alive and well! I was just hiding in the wall, waiting for the perfect moment to surprise you all!

CLEVELAND:
(voice shaking)
But... but how? We saw Death take you away!

PETER:
(laughing)
Oh, that was just a guy in a costume! I hired him to play a prank on you all!

MEG:
(voice breaking)
But, dad, we were so worried! We thought we lost you forever!

PETER:
(apologetic)
I'm sorry, Meg. I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted to play a funny prank on you all.

BRIAN:
(voice shaking)
Peter, that was a really cruel and insensitive thing to do. You shouldn't joke about death like that.

PETER:
(voice sheepish)
I know, Brian. I'm sorry. I didn't think it through. I just wanted to have a little fun.

LOIS:
(voice trembling)
Peter, please, don't ever do something like that again. You have no idea how much you scared us.

PETER:
(voice contrite)
I'm sorry, Lois. You're right. I won't do anything like that again. I promise.

The Griffins and Cleveland all look at each other, still in shock and disbelief. But they're also relieved and happy that Peter is alive and well.

CLEVELAND:
(voice shaking)
Well, I'll be damned. You really had us fooled, Peter.

PETER:
(grinning)
I know, Cleveland. And I'm sorry for that. But at least now we can all have a good laugh about it.

The Griffins and Cleveland all chuckle, still shaken but grateful that Peter is alive and well.

FADE TO BLACK.
